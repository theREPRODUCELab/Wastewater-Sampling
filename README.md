About the study

Municipal wastewater facilities contain recycled streams with high nutrient content, that can increase energy consumption in the facility and cause environmental pollution. The reduction of this load through electricity-driven nutrient recovery is a promising solution that enhances the Food-Energy-Water nexus by producing sustainable fertilizer from these facilities. This combined study investigates this recovery potential through a 1-year sampling of these recycle streams. Results showed that orthophosphate and ammonia concentrations do not show a significant correlation in any tested streams. On the other hand, major ions exhibited interdependence with orthophosphate concentration, while the stream pH was found to correlate with both orthophosphate and chloride concentrations in the anaerobic digester effluent. Subsequently, electrified nutrient recovery was characterized through multivariate screening analyses that identified 5 of 11 variables as most significant for both nutrient recovery efficiency and energy consumed during the recovery process. Finally, optimum conditions applied to a real stream resulted in 95% P recovery efficiency with 0.03 kWh/kg P recovered; hence providing key response quantities of an emerging process that could be competitive at scale with state-of-the-art nutrient synthesis and recovery routes.
